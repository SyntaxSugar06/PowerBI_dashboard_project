- Identify trends in patient admissions and discharges.
- Track the efficiency of hospital resource utilization.
- Analyze doctor performance based on patient feedback.
- Understand common diagnosis patterns to allocate resources effectively.
- Compare Health Insurance Amount vs. Billing Amount for financial insights.
